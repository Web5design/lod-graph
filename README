This is a visualization of the Linked Open Data cloud using the ProtoVis
JavaScript library. The underlying data is generated by talking to the 
Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) API. 

To generate the lod.js data file you should be able to run ckan.py:

    ./ckan.py > lod.js

It can take a few minutes to run, so go make yourself a cup of tea while
it's running. After that you should be able to load index.html in 
your browser.
