This is a visualization of the Linked Open Data [1] cloud using the Protovis 
JavaScript library [2]. The underlying data is generated by talking to the 
Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) API [3]. 

To generate the lod.js data file you should be able to run ckan.py:

    ./ckan.py > lod.js

It can take a few minutes to run, so go make yourself a cup of tea while
it's running. After that you should be able to load index.html in 
your browser.
